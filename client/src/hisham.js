                <p>
                    As first small project after the bootcamp I created a
                    website for a hairdresser in Berlin Friedrichshain. I used
                    Contentful so the owner can add, remove and edit the Images,
                    Prices, and Informations displayed on the page. The owner
                    didnâ€™t want an appointment booking tool on his page, since
                    he wants his customers to engage with him via WhatsApp, so I
                    build in a feature that lets the user select a date and time
                    which then opens WhatsApp on your device with a pre-written
                    message including the entered date.{" "}
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>created with react</li>
                    <li>deployed on Netlify</li>
                    <li>using Contentful as CMS</li>
                </ul>
